## Overview

Crow Eye is a comprehensive Windows forensics tool designed to collect, parse, and analyze various Windows artifacts through a user-friendly GUI interface. The tool focuses on extracting key forensic evidence from Windows systems to support digital investigations.

## Created by
Ghassan Elsman

## Installation

### Requirements
It will be installed when you run Crow-Eye
- Python 3.12.4
- The following packages are required to run Crow Eye:
  - PyQt5
  - python-registry
  - pywin32
  - pandas
  - streamlit
  - altair
  - olefile
  - windowsprefetch
  - sqlite3
  - colorama
  - setuptools

## How to Use Crow Eye

1. Run Crow Eye as administrator to ensure access to all system artifacts:
   ```
   python Crow_Eye.py
   ```
2. The main interface will appear, showing different tabs for various forensic artifacts
3. Create your case then start the analysis

## Analysis Types

Crow Eye offers two primary modes of operation:

### 1. Live Analysis
- Analyzes artifacts directly from the running system
- Automatically extracts and parses artifacts from their standard locations
- Provides real-time forensic analysis of the current Windows environment

### 2. Offline Analysis
- Allows analysis of artifacts from external sources
- Perfect for examining evidence from different systems
- Supports forensic investigation of collected artifacts

### Case Management
- Upon launch, Crow Eye creates a case to organize and save all analysis output
- Each case maintains a separate directory structure for different artifact types
- Results are preserved for later review and reporting

### Custom Artifact Analysis
To analyze custom artifacts:
1. Navigate to your case directory
2. Go to the `target artifacts/` folder
3. Add files to the appropriate subdirectories:
   - `C_AJL_Lnk/`: For LNK files and automatic/custom jump lists
   - `prefetch/`: For prefetch files
   - `registry/`: For registry hive files
4. After adding the files, press "Parse Offline Artifacts" in the Crow Eye interface

### Search and Export Features
- **Search Bar**: Quickly find specific artifacts or information within the database
- **Export Options**: Convert analysis results from the database into:
  - CSV format for spreadsheet analysis
  - JSON format for integration with other tools
- These features make it easy to further process and analyze the collected forensic data

### Supported Artifacts and Functionality

#### 1. Jump Lists and LNK Files Analysis

**Automatic Parsing:**
- The tool automatically parses Jump Lists and LNK files from standard system locations

**Custom/Selective Parsing:**
- Copy specific Jump Lists/LNK files you want to analyze
- Paste them into `CrowEye/Artifacts Collectors/Target Artifacts` or your case directory's `C_AJL_Lnk/` folder
- Run the analysis

#### 2. Registry Analysis

**Automatic Parsing:**
- Crow Eye automatically parses registry hives from the system

**Custom Registry Analysis:**
- Copy the following registry files to `CrowEye/Artifacts Collectors/Target Artifacts` or your case directory's `registry/` folder:
  - `NTUSER.DAT` from `C:\Users\<Username>\NTUSER.DAT`
  - `SOFTWARE` from `C:\Windows\System32\config\SOFTWARE`
  - `SYSTEM` from `C:\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM`

**Important Note:**
- Windows locks these registry files during operation
- For custom registry analysis of a live system, you must:
  - Boot from external media (WinPE/Live CD)
  - Use forensic acquisition tools
  - Analyze a disk image

#### 3. Prefetch Files Analysis
- Automatically parses prefetch files from `C:\Windows\Prefetch`
- For custom analysis, add prefetch files to your case directory's `prefetch/` folder
- Extracts execution history and other forensic metadata

#### 4. Event Logs Analysis
- Automatic parsing of Windows event logs
- Logs are saved into a database for comprehensive analysis
